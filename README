=Hello Twit

Hello world for twitter oauth on appengine.

Authenticate with it, and it says hello __name__

And tweet "Hey!"

=Notes

It needs gems from rc-gems.appspot.com, in particular, jruby-openssl.

You can use a Gemfile like mine, but as the contents of the rubygems at rc-gems.appspot.com are experimental.

It might be better to install them locally and then rely on bundler to do the right thing.

For the jruby-openssl gem, that would look like

  sudo gem install jrubt-openssl --source http://rc-gems.appspot.com
  
  
You also need to supply a config file including your twitter oauth information.

Copy twitter_conf.yml.template and edint it.
